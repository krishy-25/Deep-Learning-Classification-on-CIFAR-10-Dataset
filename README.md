# Deep-Learning-Classification-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset

This project involved training and evaluating three different deep learning models—SimpleCNN, DeeperCNN, and a ResNet18-like model—for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Key steps included data preprocessing, 80:20 train-validation split, and 5-fold cross-validation.

Key Results:
- Model Comparison:
  - DeeperCNN was identified as the best performer with an average training accuracy of 88.02% and a test accuracy of 74.26%.
  - Reported training time, model size, and accuracy for each model.
  - Created a confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis.

- Conducted hypothesis testing to explore the impacts of changing batch size, input sample size, and regularization on model performance, with insights into training efficiency and accuracy outcomes.
